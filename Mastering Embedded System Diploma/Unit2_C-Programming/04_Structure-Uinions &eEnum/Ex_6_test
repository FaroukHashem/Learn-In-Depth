sizeof(u) of data type Union wil be the biggest data type of its member which is
char name[32]-------->sizeof(name)=32
sizeof(u)=32

}s;
sizeof(s) of data type structure wil be the sum of the size of data type of its members which is
char name[32]-------->sizeof(name)     =32
float salary -------->sizeof(salary)   =4
int worker_no-------->sizeof(worker_no)=4
sizeof(u)=40
